<h1>The Best Movies According to Zach</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Blue Spring</h3>
<p>Deep characters, stories and imagery. 10/10</p>

<h3>Endgame</h3>
<p>Self-explanitory</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>wild as hell and kinda confusing, but it encapsulates humanities urge to explore the limitless void that is space - a box of mystery</p>
